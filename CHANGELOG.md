## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- License: Apache License 2.0 (was BUSL-1.1). See `LICENSE` and `NOTICE`.
- License: every file carries an Apache-2.0 SPDX header or is a documented
  exception, verified with Apache RAT.

### Fixed

- Multi-process: a wrap now lowers the shared write cursor to the data-area
  start inside the wrap-intent window instead of when its first write commits.
  Before, for the whole reservation-to-pwrite window of a wrapping write, a
  reader in any process could pass the phase-ABA positional guard with a
  two-wrap survivor at the wrap target and take a borrow that the pwrite then
  tore. A wrap whose first write failed also left the cursor high, so the next
  write wrapped again (a second phase toggle with no pass in between).
