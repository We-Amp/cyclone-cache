# Changelog

All notable changes to Cyclone Cache are documented in this file. The format is
based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `CacheConfig::readahead_min_bytes` (and `VolumeConfig::readahead_min_bytes`,
  fluent `set_readahead_min_bytes()`): a readahead hint over exactly a
  document's byte range on the disk read path (`read_sync` and the
  selected-alternate path) for documents of at least this many bytes,
  issued before the CRC pass first touches the content. Default 256 KiB;
  `0` disables it. Not exposed in the C API. Per platform:
  - Linux: `madvise(MADV_WILLNEED)`, page-aligned and in 512 KiB chunks.
  - macOS: `fcntl(F_RDADVISE)` over the file range (Darwin's
    `MADV_WILLNEED` is synchronous and serialises across processes).
  - Windows: `PrefetchVirtualMemory` (previously a no-op).
  A placement is re-advised at most once per 2 s, so warm re-reads do not
  pay for the hint.
- `CacheStats::readahead_hints_issued` (also on `VolumeStats`): readahead
  hints issued, appended at the end of `CacheStats`. C++ only; not mirrored
  in `CycloneCacheStats`.
- The Windows build now imports `PrefetchVirtualMemory` from `kernel32`, so
  the library requires Windows 8 / Windows Server 2012 or later when built
  with `_WIN32_WINNT >= 0x0602`.

### Changed

- License: Apache License 2.0 (was BUSL-1.1). See `LICENSE` and `NOTICE`.
- License: every file carries an Apache-2.0 SPDX header or is a documented
  exception, verified with Apache RAT.

### Fixed

- Multi-process: a wrap now lowers the shared write cursor to the data-area
  start inside the wrap-intent window instead of when its first write commits.
  Before, for the whole reservation-to-pwrite window of a wrapping write, a
  reader in any process could pass the phase-ABA positional guard with a
  two-wrap survivor at the wrap target and take a borrow that the pwrite then
  tore. A wrap whose first write failed also left the cursor high, so the next
  write wrapped again (a second phase toggle with no pass in between).
